"""Package a staged plugin directory into a deterministic `.orplug` archive.

An `.orplug` is a ZIP whose entries sit at the archive root (so `plugin.json`
is the first thing a reader sees and the manifest's relative paths such as
`bin/linux/x86_64/nkit` resolve against the archive root).

The archive is built deterministically — entries are sorted and every member
gets a fixed timestamp — so re-packaging the same staged files yields the same
SHA-256. That is what makes the checksum recorded in D1 independently
reproducible by anyone who rebuilds from the same inputs.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/package_orplug.py <stage_dir> <output.orplug>
